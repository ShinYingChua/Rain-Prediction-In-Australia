# Rain Prediction In Australia
The rainfall dataset which contains observations of weather metrics for each day, is obtained from Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology. In this project, classification algorithms are used to create ML model to predict rain. This project is relating to Machine Learning with Python course in IBM Data Science Profession Certificate.
