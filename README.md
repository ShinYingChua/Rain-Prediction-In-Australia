# Rain Prediction In Australia
The rainfall dataset which contains observations of weather metrics for each day, is obtained from Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology. In this project, classification algorithms are used to create ML model to predict rain. This project is relating to Machine Learning with Python course in IBM Data Science Profession Certificate.

## Algorithm
- Linear Regression
- KNN
- Decision Tree
- Logistric Regression
- SVM

## Evaluation Matrix
- Accuracy Score
  -  Ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions
- Jaccard Index
  - Measures the similarity between the predicted and true class labels
  - A high Jaccard index indicates a high degree of agreement or overlap between the predicted and true class label
- F1 Score
  - Combines both precision (the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives) and recall (the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives) into a single metric
- LogLoss
- Mean Absolute Error
- Mean Squared Error
- R2 Score

## Conclusion
The best performing model is Logistic Regression model with highest accuracy score of 83%, highest jaccard index of 50% and highest F1 score of 67%.
